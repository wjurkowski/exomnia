perl mapSNV-0.1c.pl 3pbl A rare common ~/Szafa/db/mapping_data/sifts-pdb_chain_uniprot.lst

Versions
mapSNV-0.1a.pl
	first working
mapSNV-0.1b.pl
	separate mapping of rare and common variants
mapSNV-0.1c.pl
	fetch biological assemblies
	correction of display
snv2pdb-0.2.pl
	new name and version numbering
	new name of output file
snv2pdb-0.3.pl
	corrected cases with multiple uniprot AC present in one pdb chain. This happens when chimera protein (e.g. with lysosyme) is crystalized. 
	corrected cases with broken chain - now mapping is done separately
